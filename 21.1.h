// Chapter 21 Practice Problem 1
// Write a program that contains the functions add, subtract, multiply and divide. Each of these functions should take two integers, and return the result of the operation. Create a small calculator in that uses these functions. Put the function declarations into a header file, but include the source code for these functions in your source file.
