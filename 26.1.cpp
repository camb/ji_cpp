// Chapter 26 Practice Problem 1
// Implement a sort function that takes a vector of pointers to an interface class, Comparable, that defines a method, compare(Comparable& other), and returns 0 if the objects are the same, 1 if the object is greater than other, and -1 if the object is less than other. Create a class that implements this interface, createseveral instances, abd sort them. If you're looking for some inspiration for what to create--try a HighScoreElement class that has a name and a score, and sorts so that the top scores are first, but if two scores are the same, they are sorted next by name.
