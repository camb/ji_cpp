// Chapter 26 Practice Problem 2
// Provide another implementation of your sort function, this time taking an interface called Comparator, which has a method compace(const string& lhs, const string& rhs) that follows similar rules to the previous compare method: return 0 if the two values are the same, 1 if lhs > rhs or -1 if lhs < rhs. Write two different classes to do comparisson: one that does a case-insensitive comparison and one that sorts in reverse alphabetical order.
